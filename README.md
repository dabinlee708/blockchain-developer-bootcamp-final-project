Decentralized Game Rental

Although we're seeing changes in the gaming industry where lots of games are no longer physically delivered to customers and instead streamed through cloud gaming instances or delivered digitally with no physical cartridges, CDs, DVDs, Chips and etc. However, there are still large number of games being published and sold in a physical format for various reasons and many gamers prefer the physical copy due to its resale value and being able to share it with friends. 

Often, pre-owned game titles were either rented from Small-medium enterprises or individuals where each game title belongs to the owner and had to be checked if the customer-returned game titles are in a good state after rental has been completed. This required the ones renting to have thorough checks on the game titles so that they can be rented out for a longer period of time, increasing the total return of the game title being rented.

Using blockchain and smart contracts, it is possible to remove the renter's responsibility to the participants who are renting the titles. By creating smart contracts which require certain amount of crypto assets as deposit and subtracting from it based on the duration of retnal, it is possible to make sure whoever borrows the title inspects the title thoroughly and give "clearance" to the previous renter. Furthermore, by removing a need for physical location as renters will be passing the games to each other, costs which would have been needed to fund such places and hire employees can be removed and be used to even lower the cost of rental, providing greater total-return-value to the game rental, incentivizing participants who would add their games to the blockchain.

Furthermore, based on the conditions set by the game title owner, the "renter" can always purchase the game at a previously-set price via smart contracts.

Decentralized Game Rental
1. Game-title owners can rent out their games through decentralized game rental blockchain, without a need to verify the borrower's identity as smart contract ensures sufficient deposit is paid out to the owner if anything goes wrong with the game title
2. Game-title owners can also set conditions in the smart contract to set a "purchase-this-game" price where the borrower can terminate the rental contract and buy the game at a pre-defined price.
3. As borrowers put deposit, the responsibility of the borrowers include checking if the game is in good condition to confirm that no damage has been done by the previous borrower.
4. As the game can be passed through from borrower to borrower, delivery or meetup could be an issue. However, the borrowers would be incentivized to find renters if the game cannot be returned to the onwer anymore. At this point, the borrower has an option to purchase the game instead and rent it out in case the cost of renting exceeds the value of the game. 
5. Whenever disputes happen, history of rental can be easily verified and tracked down. Good standing history of a particular user could be used to incetivizes the user with lower rental fees since the risk is low as well for the game owner.
6. Upon completion of rental, via smart contract, deposit can be returned immediately after deducting the rental cost.
7. With public access to the chain, anyone can look up on the rental statistics and make informed decisions if they want to buy/sell/rent/borrow game titles depending on the market demand.
